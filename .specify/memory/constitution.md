# PulsePlay AI Constitution

## Project Context

**Project Name**: PulsePlay AI  
**Mission**: Transform typing rhythm and mouse activity into personalized, adaptive focus music powered by AI-augmented creativity  
**Target Users**: Developers, writers, designers, neurodiverse professionals, and productivity-focused individuals seeking intelligent, emotionally resonant ambient soundscapes  
**Core Technology**: Real-time audio synthesis via Web Audio API, rhythm detection from user input patterns, AI-powered music generation via Gemini API and Gradient AI

**Key Differentiators**:
- **AI-augmented creativity**: Gemini API and Gradient AI generate intelligent, context-aware music feedback
- **Real-time audio generation**: No pre-recorded loops, pure synthesis
- **Adaptive tempo**: Music responds to user activity patterns in real-time
- **Experience-first design**: Distraction-free, intuitive interface with seamless audio-visual synchronization
- **Data-respectful architecture**: Minimal data collection, MongoDB anonymization, user control
- **Open source integrity**: Educational clarity, transparent workflow, community-driven development
- **Neurodiverse inclusivity**: Accessibility mode, sensory-friendly features, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Core Principles

### I. Experience-First Design

PulsePlay prioritizes user experience above all else. Every feature MUST enhance the user's ability to focus, flow, and feel immersed in the adaptive music environment.

**Interface Requirements:**
- **Intuitive**: New users should understand core functionality within 30 seconds
- **Distraction-free**: Zero visual clutter, essential controls only, hidden complexity
- **Aesthetically consistent**: TailwindCSS design system, cohesive color palette (slate-900 to slate-700, blue-500 accents), smooth transitions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach, breakpoints at sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px, xl:1280px

**Audio-Visual Synchronization:**
- Visualizer MUST pulse in sync with generated audio (60fps canvas animation)
- Volume slider MUST reflect actual audio gain in real-time
- Mood transitions MUST be smooth (crossfade between states, no abrupt changes)
- Loading states MUST provide meaningful feedback ("Generating AI insights...")

**Accessibility & Neurodiverse Inclusivity (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus indicators
- **Sensory-friendly mode**: Lower frequency ranges, reduced visual intensity, option to disable animations
- **Reduced motion support**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for interactive elements
- **Screen reader compatibility**: Descriptive labels for all audio controls and visualizer states

**User Testing:**
- Every major feature MUST be tested with at least one neurodiverse user before release
- Accessibility violations BLOCK PR merge
- User feedback MUST inform design iterations

**Rationale**: Focus tools live or die by their user experience. If the interface creates friction or the audio feels disconnected, users will abandon the tool. Neurodiverse inclusivity isn't a feature—it's fundamental to the mission of enhancing focus for all cognitive styles.

---

### II. AI-Augmented Creativity

PulsePlay integrates AI not as a gimmick but as a creative partner. Gemini API and Gradient AI services MUST **augment** user experience by generating intelligent, emotionally resonant music feedback.

**AI Integration Standards:**
- **Value-driven**: Every AI interaction MUST add measurable value (personalization, insight, adaptation)
- **Context-aware**: AI-generated content MUST align with user context (focus, calm, energy modes)
- **Transparent**: Gemini prompts MUST be logged for reproducibility and debugging
- **Fail-safe**: AI failures MUST degrade gracefully (fallback to rule-based synthesis)

**Gemini API Usage:**
- **Mood insights**: Generate contextual feedback based on session metrics (rhythm patterns, duration, intensity)
- **Prompt engineering**: Use few-shot examples, clear instructions, structured outputs (JSON when possible)
- **Rate limiting**: Respect API limits, implement exponential backoff, cache responses where appropriate
- **Error handling**: Catch API errors, log failures, never block core audio functionality

**Gradient AI Services:**
- **Music personalization**: Generate adaptive audio parameters based on user preferences and historical data
- **Emotional resonance**: Map rhythm intensity to musical qualities (tempo, harmony, timbre)
- **Learning loop**: User feedback (explicit ratings or implicit session duration) MUST inform future generations

**AI Transparency Requirements:**
- Log all Gemini prompts and responses (sanitized, no PII) for reproducibility
- Display AI-generated insights with clear attribution ("AI-generated based on your focus pattern")
- Provide opt-out option for users who prefer non-AI experience
- Document AI decision-making logic in `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Prohibited AI Practices:**
- AI as a black box (all prompts must be auditable)
- AI replacing human creativity (AI assists, doesn't automate away artistry)
- AI collecting sensitive data without explicit consent
- AI hallucinations presented as facts (validate outputs, acknowledge uncertainty)

**Rationale**: AI should amplify human creativity and focus, not replace it. Gemini and Gradient AI enable PulsePlay to be more than a synthesizer—it becomes an intelligent companion that understands and adapts to individual work patterns. Transparency builds trust; value builds retention.

---

### III. Data-Respectful Architecture

User data (typing rhythm, focus sessions, preferences) MUST be handled with the utmost care. PulsePlay is built on data ethics, not data exploitation.

**Minimal Data Collection:**
- **Client-side processing**: Rhythm detection (keystrokes, mouse movements) NEVER leaves the browser
- **Aggregated storage**: Database stores session summaries only (duration, keystroke count, rhythm metrics)
- **No raw data**: Actual keystroke content, mouse coordinates, or audio waveforms NEVER stored
- **User control**: Users can delete all data at any time (right to be forgotten)

**MongoDB Schema Principles:**
- **Anonymization**: Use hashed user IDs where possible, avoid storing identifiable information
- **Minimal retention**: Session data auto-deleted after 90 days unless user explicitly saves
- **Granular permissions**: Users control what data is collected (opt-in for rhythm tracking, AI insights)
- **Schema versioning**: MongoDB schemas documented in `DB_SCHEMA.md`, migrations tracked

**MongoDB Security Standards:**
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (RBAC), least-privilege principle
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs, use Mongoose schemas for type safety
- **Query safety**: Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation for query building

**Data Transparency:**
- **Privacy policy**: Clear, jargon-free explanation of what data is collected and why
- **Data export**: Users can download all their data in JSON format
- **Data dashboard**: Show users exactly what data PulsePlay has stored about them
- **Audit logs**: Track data access patterns, log anomalies

**Compliance Standards:**
- **Open data ethics**: Follow open source data principles (transparency, user control, minimal collection)
- **GDPR-aligned**: Right to access, right to deletion, right to portability (even if not legally required)
- **No third-party tracking**: No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or other surveillance capitalism tools
- **Consent-driven**: Explicit opt-in for any data collection beyond core functionality

**Data Ethics Checklist:**
- [ ] Is this data necessary for core functionality?
- [ ] Can we aggregate or anonymize this data?
- [ ] Have we informed users why we collect this?
- [ ] Can users delete this data themselves?
- [ ] Is this data encrypted at rest and in transit?

**Rationale**: Users trust PulsePlay with intimate data about their work patterns and focus rhythms. This trust is sacred. Data-respectful architecture isn't about compliance—it's about treating users as humans, not data sources. MongoDB's flexibility enables privacy-by-design without sacrificing functionality.

---

### IV. Open Source Integrity

PulsePlay is built for the open source community. Every line of code, every design decision, every architectural choice MUST be transparent, documented, and welcoming to contributors.

**Code Documentation Standards:**
- **JSDoc required**: Every function, hook, component MUST have JSDoc with @param, @returns, @example
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Generates AI-powered mood insights using Gemini API.
   * @param sessionMetrics - Aggregated session data (duration, keystrokes, rhythm)
   * @param userContext - User's selected mood (focus, calm, energy)
   * @returns Promise resolving to AI-generated insight text
   * @throws {GeminiAPIError} If API call fails after retries
   * @example
   * const insight = await generateMoodInsight(metrics, 'focus');
   * console.log(insight); // "Your steady rhythm suggests deep concentration..."
   */
  ```
- **README clarity**: Quick start in <5 minutes, feature list, troubleshooting, prerequisites
- **Architecture documentation**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` with ASCII diagrams, data flows, component hierarchy
- **API reference**: `API_REFERENCE.md` with all hooks, components, Gemini/Gradient AI integration patterns
- **Educational comments**: Explain "why" in code comments, not "what" (code should be self-documenting)

**Versioning & Change Management:**
- **Semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.1.3)
  - MAJOR: Breaking API changes, principle removals
  - MINOR: New features, backward-compatible enhancements
  - PATCH: Bug fixes, typos, clarifications
- **Changelog maintenance**: `CHANGELOG.md` updated with every release (Keep a Changelog format)
- **Git tagging**: Every release tagged in git (e.g., `v2.1.3`)
- **Migration guides**: Breaking changes MUST include migration documentation

**Contribution Workflow (Transparent & Welcoming):**
1. **Issue first**: Discuss features/bugs in GitHub issues before coding
2. **Fork & branch**: Fork repo, create descriptive branch (`feature/gemini-insights`, `fix/canvas-flicker`)
3. **Commit conventions**: Conventional Commits format (`feat(ai): add Gemini API mood insights`)
4. **Pull request**: Clear description, link to issue, screenshots/videos for UI changes
5. **Code review**: Maintainers review within 48 hours, provide constructive feedback
6. **Merge & celebrate**: Merge to main, add contributor to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, release notes credit

**Educational Clarity (Onboarding in 1 Hour):**
- **Setup script**: `npm run setup` automates environment configuration
- **Contributor guide**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` with step-by-step onboarding
- **Code tour**: `CODE_TOUR.md` explains project structure, key files, where to start
- **Beginner-friendly issues**: Label issues with `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `documentation`
- **Pair programming**: Offer live pairing sessions for new contributors (Discord/Zoom)

**Dependency Policy:**
- **Open source preferred**: Prioritize MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD licenses
- **No closed-source dependencies**: Unless absolutely necessary (e.g., Gemini API, Gradient AI APIs)
  - Exception justification MUST be documented in `DEPENDENCIES.md`
  - Fallback to open alternatives MUST be planned (e.g., local LLM for Gemini API)
- **License compatibility**: All dependencies MUST be compatible with project license (check with `license-checker`)

**Community Standards:**
- **Code of Conduct**: Welcoming, respectful, harassment-free environment (Contributor Covenant)
- **Inclusive language**: Use gender-neutral pronouns, avoid ableist terms, prioritize clarity
- **Credit attribution**: Credit all contributors in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, release notes, documentation
- **Public roadmap**: Share project direction in GitHub projects, invite community input

**Rationale**: Open source thrives on transparency and accessibility. If a new contributor can't understand the codebase within an hour, we've failed. If a user can't see how their data is used, we've failed. Open source integrity means treating every contributor as a valued partner, not free labor.

### V. Simplicity and Observability

PulsePlay embraces simplicity, modularity, and measurable quality. Avoid over-engineering; follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.

**Simplicity Principles:**
- **YAGNI**: Don't build features "for the future"—build what users need today
- **KISS**: Prefer simple solutions over clever ones (readable code > clever code)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, function, component does one thing well
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Optimize only when profiling identifies bottlenecks
- **Delete code**: Removing code is progress (eliminate dead code, unused dependencies)

**Modular Design:**
- **Loose coupling**: Modules communicate via clear interfaces, minimal dependencies
- **High cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together (e.g., all Gemini API logic in `services/geminiService.ts`)
- **Testability**: Every module MUST be testable in isolation (dependency injection, mocking)
- **Replaceability**: Swap implementations without rewriting dependents (e.g., replace Gemini with local LLM)

**Structured Logging:**
- **Rhythm analysis**: Log rhythm detection metrics (BPM, intensity, keystroke velocity) for debugging
  ```typescript
  logger.info('rhythm_detected', {
    bpm: 120,
    intensity: 0.75,
    keystroke_count: 45,
    session_duration_ms: 180000
  });
  ```
- **AI interactions**: Log Gemini API calls (prompts, responses, latency, errors)
  ```typescript
  logger.info('gemini_api_call', {
    prompt_hash: 'abc123',
    response_length: 256,
    latency_ms: 450,
    tokens_used: 128
  });
  ```
- **Audio engine performance**: Log audio node creation, cleanup, buffer underruns
  ```typescript
  logger.debug('audio_node_created', {
    type: 'OscillatorNode',
    frequency: 440,
    gain: 0.5,
    active_nodes_count: 12
  });
  ```
- **Structured format**: Use JSON logging (pino, winston) for machine-readable logs
- **Log levels**: DEBUG (development), INFO (production events), WARN (recoverable errors), ERROR (failures)

**Observability Standards:**
- **Metrics**: Track key performance indicators (session duration, AI insight generation time, audio latency)
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for AI API calls (Gemini, Gradient AI) to identify bottlenecks
- **Alerts**: Monitor critical failures (AI API downtime, audio engine crashes, database connection loss)
- **Dashboards**: Real-time observability dashboard (Grafana, custom React dashboard)

**Testing Strategy (Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic):**
- **Unit tests**: Test pure functions, utilities, hooks in isolation (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions, API integrations, database operations
- **E2E tests**: Test critical user journeys (start session, generate AI insight, export data)
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark audio engine latency, rhythm detection speed, canvas rendering FPS
- **Coverage target**: 70%+ for critical paths (audio engine, AI integration, data persistence)
- **Test maintenance**: Delete tests for removed features, update tests with code changes

**Code Quality Without Bureaucracy:**
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Biome.js**: All-in-one toolchain for linting, formatting, and import sorting (unified replacement for ESLint + Prettier)
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run linting, formatting, type checking before commit (Husky + lint-staged)
- **CI/CD**: Automated checks on every PR (build, lint, format, test, type check)

**Debugging Efficiency:**
- **Error boundaries**: Catch React errors, display user-friendly fallback UI
- **Source maps**: Enable in production for better error stack traces
- **Reproducible bugs**: Logs MUST contain enough context to reproduce issues
- **Fail fast**: Detect errors early (assertions, type guards, runtime validation)

**Rationale**: Complexity is the enemy of reliability. Simple code is easier to understand, test, debug, and maintain. Observability turns PulsePlay from a black box into a transparent system where every behavior is measurable, every failure is traceable, and every performance issue is quantifiable. YAGNI and KISS keep development velocity high and technical debt low.
