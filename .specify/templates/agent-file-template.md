# [PROJECT NAME] Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

## Constitution Compliance

This project follows the principles defined in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v2.0.0):

1. **Experience-First Design**: Prioritize UX above all—intuitive, distraction-free, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), audio-visual synchronization
2. **AI-Augmented Creativity**: Integrate Gemini API / Gradient AI as creative partners—transparent, value-driven, fail-safe
3. **Data-Respectful Architecture**: Minimal data collection, MongoDB anonymization, user control (delete, export), open data ethics
4. **Open Source Integrity**: Transparent workflow, educational clarity (1-hour onboarding), comprehensive documentation, community-driven
5. **Simplicity and Observability**: YAGNI/KISS principles, structured logging (rhythm, AI, audio), modular design, pragmatic testing (70%+ coverage)

All features and tasks must comply with these principles.
