## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach (Recommended)

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) = User Stories 1 + 2**:
- **Phase 1**: Setup (1-2 days)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (3-4 days)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Ambient music + sessions (3-4 days)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Waveform visualization (2-3 days)
- **Validation**: Test MVP with 5-10 users (1-2 days)
- **Total MVP timeline**: ~10-15 days

**Incremental Delivery**: After MVP validation, add User Stories 3-6 in priority order

### Full Feature Timeline

- **Phases 1-2**: 4-6 days (setup + foundation)
- **Phases 3-4**: 5-7 days (P1 user stories - MVP)
- **Phases 5-6**: 4-6 days (P2 user stories - core features)
- **Phases 7-8**: 5-7 days (P3 user stories - analytics)
- **Phase 9**: 3-4 days (polish + constitution compliance)
- **Total timeline**: ~21-30 days (single developer, sequential work)

### Team Parallelization

With 2-3 developers, user stories can be parallelized after Foundational phase:
- Developer 1: US1 + US3 (ambient music + instrumental sounds)
- Developer 2: US2 + US4 (waveform + instrument selection)
- Developer 3: US5 + US6 (AI insights + session history)
- **Parallel timeline**: ~14-20 days
