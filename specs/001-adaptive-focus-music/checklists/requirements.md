# Requirements Validation Checklist
# Feature: Adaptive Focus Music Engine

**Feature Number**: 001  
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: ✅ PASS

---

## Quality Criteria Validation

### 1. ✅ No Implementation Details in User Stories

**Check**: User stories describe WHAT users do and WHY, not HOW the system implements it.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ All 6 user stories focus on user behavior and outcomes
- ✅ Technical details confined to Requirements section (FR-001 to FR-020)
- ✅ Example: "A user opens the application, selects a mood (calm, focus, or energy), and clicks 'Start Session'" (what) vs "System MUST detect keyboard keystrokes in real-time using browser keyboard event listeners (keydown events)" (how)

---

### 2. ✅ All Requirements Are Testable

**Check**: Each functional requirement can be verified through automated or manual testing.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 20/20 functional requirements include specific, measurable criteria:
  - FR-001: "detect keyboard keystrokes in real-time" → Testable: log keydown events, verify timestamp <50ms
  - FR-003: "calculate typing tempo based on a rolling 30-second window, updated every 5 seconds" → Testable: type at known rate, verify calculated BPM matches expected
  - FR-007: "provide three selectable moods" → Testable: verify UI displays 3 mood options, clicking each triggers correct ambient BPM range
  - FR-015: "provide accessibility mode: lower frequency instrument sounds (200-800 Hz)" → Testable: enable accessibility mode, analyze audio spectrum, verify frequency range
  - FR-020: "log rhythm detection events using structured JSON logging" → Testable: trigger BPM change, verify JSON log entry exists with expected fields

---

### 3. ✅ Success Criteria Are Measurable

**Check**: Success criteria include quantifiable metrics with thresholds.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 14/14 success criteria are measurable with specific thresholds:
  - SC-001: "within 2 seconds" → Timer measurement
  - SC-002: "within 50ms" → Latency measurement
  - SC-005: "90% of users successfully complete" → Completion rate percentage
  - SC-007: "within 3 seconds of session completion" → API response time
  - SC-009: "<5 second lag" → Real-time update latency
  - SC-011: "85%+ of post-session surveys (5-point Likert scale: 4-5 = non-distracting)" → Survey data with threshold
  - SC-013: "70% of users who complete 3+ sessions report improved focus awareness" → Self-reported metric with threshold

---

### 4. ✅ User Stories Are Prioritized

**Check**: Each user story has clear priority with justification.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 6 user stories prioritized with rationale:
  - **P1 MVP (2 stories)**: US1 (ambient music), US2 (waveform visualization) → Foundation features
  - **P2 (2 stories)**: US3 (adaptive instruments), US4 (instrument selection) → Core differentiation
  - **P3 (2 stories)**: US5 (AI recommendations), US6 (session history) → Engagement features
- ✅ Each priority includes "Why this priority" explanation
- ✅ MVP clearly defined (P1 stories deliver basic focus music experience)

---

### 5. ✅ Edge Cases Identified

**Check**: Specification addresses boundary conditions, failures, and unusual scenarios.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 7 edge cases documented with clear handling strategies:
  - Extreme typing speed (200+ keystrokes/min) → Capping mechanism
  - Rapid mouse clicking → Throttling to every other click
  - Unsupported browser (no Web Audio API) → Compatibility warning
  - Gemini API failure → Graceful degradation to generic tips
  - Extended inactivity (5/10 minute thresholds) → Session prompt
  - Mid-session accessibility mode change → Smooth transitions
  - Multiple instruments + fast typing → Intelligent distribution

---

### 6. ✅ Key Entities Defined

**Check**: Core data models are documented with attributes and relationships.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 4 key entities with complete attributes:
  - **FocusSession**: 11 attributes (sessionId, userId, startTime, endTime, duration, totalKeystrokes, totalClicks, averageTempo, selectedMood, selectedInstruments, aiInsight, createdAt), relationship to User
  - **RhythmMetrics**: 6 attributes (currentBPM, rollingAvgBPM, tempoTrend, activityLevel, lastKeystrokeTimestamp, keystrokeVelocity), relationship to FocusSession
  - **UserPreferences**: 6 attributes (userId, defaultMood, defaultInstruments, masterVolume, accessibilityModeEnabled, createdAt, updatedAt), relationship to User
  - **AIMoodRecommendation**: 6 attributes (recommendationId, sessionId, suggestedMood, rationale, confidence, generatedAt, geminiModel), relationship to FocusSession

---

### 7. ✅ Acceptance Scenarios Are Concrete

**Check**: Each user story has testable Given-When-Then scenarios.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 30 total acceptance scenarios across 6 user stories:
  - US1: 5 scenarios (default mood, mood selection, volume adjustment, session stop)
  - US2: 5 scenarios (keystroke pulse, rapid typing, inactivity, mouse click, accessibility)
  - US3: 7 scenarios (instrument sound, tempo matching, speed adaptation, multiple instruments, mouse clicks, inactivity, accessibility)
  - US4: 6 scenarios (instrument selection, multi-select, de-selection, mid-session switch, no instruments, electric piano behavior)
  - US5: 5 scenarios (steady fast typing recommendation, erratic slow typing, short session, API failure, weekly summary)
  - US6: 5 scenarios (real-time stats, tempo updates, session history, filtering, export data)
- ✅ All scenarios use Given-When-Then format with specific, testable conditions

---

### 8. ✅ Constitution Compliance Verified

**Check**: Feature aligns with all 5 principles of PulsePlay AI Constitution (v2.1.0).

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ **Experience-First Design**:
  - 30-second understanding: Simple mood selection + start button
  - WCAG 2.1 AA: Accessibility mode (FR-015), keyboard nav, ARIA labels, color contrast
  - Audio-visual sync: SC-002 (50ms waveform response), SC-003 (100ms audio latency)

- ✅ **AI-Augmented Creativity**:
  - Gemini API integration: FR-013 (mood recommendations), FR-014 (graceful fallback)
  - Transparent: FR-020 (structured logging of AI prompts/responses)
  - Value-driven: US5 (personalized insights improve over time)

- ✅ **Data-Respectful Architecture**:
  - Minimal collection: FR-011 (no keystroke content, only aggregated metrics)
  - Anonymization: FocusSession entity (hashed userId, no PII)
  - User control: FR-018 (export data as JSON), deletion on request

- ✅ **Open Source Integrity**:
  - JSDoc required: Constitution compliance checklist item
  - README/ARCHITECTURE updates: Constitution compliance checklist item
  - 1-hour onboarding: Constitution compliance checklist item

- ✅ **Simplicity and Observability**:
  - YAGNI/KISS: Out of scope section (no gamification, no social features, no premium tiers)
  - Structured logging: FR-020 (JSON logs via pino for rhythm metrics, AI latency)
  - Modular design: Separate hooks (useAudioEngine, useRhythmDetection, useSessionPersistence)
  - Testable: 70%+ coverage (Constitution compliance checklist item)

---

### 9. ✅ Assumptions Are Explicit

**Check**: Specification documents environmental and context assumptions.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 10 assumptions clearly stated:
  - Browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14.1+)
  - Input devices (keyboard + mouse, no mobile)
  - API quotas (Gemini API sufficient, fallback to generic tips)
  - Language (English only for MVP)
  - Volume defaults (50% comfortable)
  - Session tracking accuracy (±5 seconds acceptable)
  - User perception (Lofi aesthetic non-distracting)
  - Database tier (MongoDB Atlas free tier <100 users)
  - Auth tier (Auth0 free tier sufficient)

---

### 10. ✅ Scope Boundaries Defined

**Check**: Out-of-scope items are explicitly listed to prevent scope creep.

**Result**: PASS

- ✅ 11 out-of-scope items documented:
  - Mobile/tablet native apps
